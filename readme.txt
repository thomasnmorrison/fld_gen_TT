readme.txt

Readme file for field_gen_TT.

This is a program for generating Gaussian traceless transverse fields in three diminsions from supplied spectra. There number of fields generated is user specified (this includes the possibility of generating cannonically conjugate pairs of fields).

Future development
--------------------
 - Allow for the generation of fields based on helicity, rather than just polarization. This is only applicable to the case of generating pair of field/momentum.
